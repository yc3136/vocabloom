## Product Vision
Vocabloom aims to be an engaging, AI-powered platform that addresses a key pain point for multilingual parents: it is often difficult to keep up with their children's English learning, especially when it comes to mapping complex or uncommon terms (like dinosaur names) back to their native language and finding quality content to assist in teaching.

Vocabloom simplifies multilingual learning by providing instant, rich, and contextually relevant content (translations and explanations) for any given term. Our vision is to make language acquisition more intuitive and personalized through generative AI, empowering parents to support their children's learning journey with ease.

## Target Audience
New parents and guardians seeking engaging, easy-to-use tools to introduce new vocabulary to children in multiple languages.

## Success Metrics
- **Translation Accuracy:** At least 90% of user-submitted terms receive correct and contextually appropriate translations, as measured by user feedback or periodic review.
- **User Task Completion Rate:** At least 95% of users are able to successfully generate and view a translation without encountering critical errors.
- **User Satisfaction:** Achieve a user satisfaction score of 4 out of 5 or higher, based on periodic in-app surveys regarding usefulness and ease of use.

## Supported Languages
Vocabloom will support all major world languages, leveraging the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs). The platform is designed to easily expand and currently supports 80+ languages. The exact list of supported languages can be defined and refined as needed.

## Roadmap

### Milestone 1: MVP Launch
- **Purpose:** Deliver a core generative AI experience where users can create unique language learning content via text translation. This MVP will validate the core value proposition for multilingual families and lay the foundation for future product enhancements.

#### Functional Requirements
1. Users can input an English term (e.g., "dinosaur," "galaxy") into a dedicated field.
2. Users can select a target language (e.g., Chinese (Simplified), Spanish, French) from a predefined list.
3. When users submit their term and language selection, the system generates and displays a concise translation or explanation of the English term in the chosen target language.
4. The system validates user input and provides clear error messages for invalid or empty submissions.
5. If a translation cannot be generated, the user is informed with a helpful message.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** AI content generation should complete and display within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., typically under 5 seconds for text).
- **Reliability:** The system should handle external API failures gracefully, providing informative and actionable messages to the user.
- **Usability:** The user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate, requiring minimal instruction.
- **Testing:** The MVP should be tested for basic functionality and usability before release.
